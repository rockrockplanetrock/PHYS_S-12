<h3>Input: Sensors</h3> <br> 

<p>After class, I decided to try out the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkOyy7orZ6gIVRdbACh3phQKgEAAYASAAEgKdXvD_BwE">Adafruit HUZZAH32 â€“ ESP32 Feather Board</a> for my sensor tests rather than my reliable <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3505">Adafruit METRO M0 Express</a>. While it took a few minutes to adapt, I think I can now say that I'm mostly comfortable switching between the two microcontrollers. </p>


<h3>Assignment #1: Measure a Physical Quantity & Calibrate Sensor </h3>

I chose <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/ALS-PT204-6C%2FL177/1080-1019-ND/2675510?WT.z_cid=ref_Globalspec_buynow">this phototransistor</a> as my sensor of choice. Specifically, this sensor is a "630nm radial phototransistor" for measuring visible light wavelengths (with peak sensitivity at 630nm). 

I set up the circuit as shown using a slightly modified (75ms delay between reads) version of the default AnalogReadSerial program. I used a 1k and 10k Ohm for my first two attempts, but found that the sensor was hardly sensitive enough to measure for this exercise. Thus, I decided my calibration would implement a 330k Ohm resistor.

 After creating a light "shield" out of a post-it note, I used the flashlight on my cellphone to expose the phototransistor to measurable and variable light. Below are my measurements.  When plotting, I played with making the vertical axis scale logarithmic and linear.

<img src="./330kohm2.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:40%" alt="330K Ohm Graph 2">

<p>Afterwards, I tried a 10M Ohm resistor, but the baseline value without light was 500, so it was too sensitive to be useful.Given my findings, the output signal scale XXX; the relationship between light absorbed and serial monitor output was inverse. It ranged between 0 and 3110 and was most sensitive between 2-8"; I think the measurement is best conducted when the light source is 18" away from the sensor (or less). I attempted to use the map() function, but the results weren't helpful for plotting.</p>


<h3>Assignment #2 DIY Sensor Construction + Calibration</h3>

<p>First, I made a test sensor using velostat with two small pieces of copper tape adhered to each side of the velostat(without making contact). I attached alligator clips to the distal end of both copper pieces to connect one to GND and the other to A0. The analog pin A0 functioned here as a PULLUP because it sent out voltage. connected one to GND pieces of copperof the velostat with alligator clips connected to each. </p>

Making Sense of it



<p>My Code:
<pre><code class="language-arduino">
const int analogInPin = A0;  

// value read from the Velostat
int sensorValue = 0;        

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication
  Serial.begin(9600);
  digitalWrite(analogInPin, HIGH);

}

void loop() {
  // read analog value
  sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);

  // print results
  Serial.print("sensor = " );
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
}
</code></pre></p>
