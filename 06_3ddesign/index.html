  <h4>Class 5: 3D Design</h4><br>

<h3>In Class</h3>

<p>We learned a lot about 3D printing and Prusa-- I couldn't wait to capture an object and put it into a the slicing program. However, this did not go as expected. I tried a soda can, a dog figurine, and the mini shopping cart below and none of them seemed to make the cut.</p>

<h3>3D Scanning</h3>
Part of our homework was to try out a 3D scanning app. I have an Android device, so I downloaded the top 3 apps in the Play Store. I'm not impressed with my results to say the least. I may try another free app, but the technology does not seem to be where I think it should be at this time. Look how wonky my attempts were below.
      <br>
      <li> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lvonasek.arcore3dscanner">3D Scanner for AR Core: not functional whatsoever.</a>
      <li> <a href="https://display.land/sunset">display.land:</a> could not render a soda can, but it did function. However, over the weekend the app informed me that it was no longer in use.
      <li> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartmobilevision.scann3d">SCANN3D:</a> definitely my best bet, but even after 5 attempts, I could not capture a small dog figurine.

<h3>Thinking about 3D Design + the Final Project</h3>
 
I spent a lot of time working out my design for my final project on paper and then moved to Fusion 360 after ordering a spring from Century Spring as shown below. I modeled the spring because their CAD file link wasn't functioning to ensure my pieces would fit as I thought they would.
